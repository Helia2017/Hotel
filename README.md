## User Story:

As a user, I want to find and book a room easily on the platform.
I start by visiting the platform and selecting "Check Rooms" from the main menu. The system then presents me with a list of available rooms. After browsing the options, I choose a room that fits my preferences. The system then prompts me to fill out a form with details like check-in and check-out dates, number of guests, and any additional requirements.
Once I've completed the form, the system generates a unique booking ID for me. I'm instructed to keep this ID handy for when I check in to the room. At this point, I also have the option to create an account to track my booking history and preferences.
Opting to create an account, I select the "Create Account" option and fill in my personal details. The system saves this information securely for future use. With my account created, I'm directed back to the home screen where I can see my booking details and any other relevant information.
Now, whenever I return to the platform, I can log in to my account to quickly access my booking history and make new reservations with ease.
